      "answers": {
        "a": "The Fermi level represents the highest occupied energy level at absolute zero.",
        "b": "The Fermi level is the energy level which has a fermi probability for intrinsic silicon as  50%.",

        "a": "The Fermi level represents the highest occupied energy level at absolute zero, while the Fermi function gives the probability of an energy state being occupied at a given temperature.",

        "a": "The actual mass of an electron in free space.",

        "a": "A modified mass that accounts for the interaction of an electron with the periodic crystal lattice. It arises due to the interaction of electrons with the periodic potential of the crystal lattice, which modifies the electron's motion. The effective mass is derived from the curvature of the energy vs. momentum (E-k) relationship and allows electrons in a crystal to be treated as though they were free particles with a modified mass.",
