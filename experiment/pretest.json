      "question": "1. Electrons in a lattice structure are influenced by the atomic potential. How does the periodic arrangement of the atoms in semiconductor lattice affect the energy levels of electrons?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The energy states form continuous bands and continuum of energy bands .",
        "b": "The energy levels remain discrete.",
        "c": "The energy levels overlap completely.",
        "d": "The energy levels are unaffected by the lattice."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The periodicity of the lattice causes the allowed energy states for electrons to form bands. These bands represent continuous ranges of energies where electrons can exist. Between these bands, there is often a band gap where no electron states exist. The conduction band (higher energy states) and valence band (lower energy states) are separated by this gap.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The periodicity of the lattice causes the allowed energy states for electrons to form bands. These bands represent continuous ranges of energies where electrons can exist. Between these bands, there is often a band gap where no electron states exist. The conduction band (higher energy states) and valence band (lower energy states) are separated by this gap.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The periodicity of the lattice causes the allowed energy states for electrons to form bands. These bands represent continuous ranges of energies where electrons can exist.

      "question": "2. What is the maximum energy an electron can have in valence band in silicon?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "infinite",
        "b": "Band gap energy",
        "c": "$E_v$",
        "d": "$E_c$"
      },
      "explanations":{
        "a": "Incorrect. Inside an atom elctrons have finite energies",
        "b": "Incorrect. Band gap energy is the minimum energy needed for an electron to jump to the conduction band",
        "c": "correct",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is higher than the maximum valence energy "

      "question": "3. What does the square of the solution of the Schrödinger wave function signify?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The exact location of an electron at a given time.",
        "b": "The probability density of finding an electron in a given region of space.",
        "c": "The energy levels of the electron without any spatial information.",
        "d": "The path an electron follows around the nucleus."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The wave function (ψ) describes the quantum state of a particle, such as an electron in an atom or a molecule. The square of the absolute value of the wave function, ∣ψ(x,t)∣2, gives the probability density of finding the particle at a particular position in space at a particular time.",
        "b": "Correct. The wave function (ψ) describes the quantum state of a particle, such as an electron in an atom or a molecule. The square of the absolute value of the wave function, ∣ψ(x,t)∣2, gives the probability density of finding the particle at a particular position in space at a particular time.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The wave function (ψ) describes the quantum state of a particle, such as an electron in an atom or a molecule. The square of the absolute value of the wave function, ∣ψ(x,t)∣2, gives the probability density of finding the particle at a particular position in space at a particular time.",

      "question": "4. Which of the following is false?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Fermi function gives the probability of a state being filled by electron",
        "b": "Fermi function helps infer probability of a state filled by holes",
        "c": "The value of fermi function, f(E), increases as E(energy) increases",
        "d": "Higher the value of E, higher is it's probability of being empty."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is true - see fermi function definition",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is also true. 1-f(E) is the probability of a state being empty",
        "c": "Correct. This statement is false",
        "d": "Incorrect. This option is true. Electrons tend to fill lower energy states first."
