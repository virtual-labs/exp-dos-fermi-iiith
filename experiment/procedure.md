### Procedure
First the user is tested of their knowledge of the fermi level. This is doing by asking them to choose the appropriate value of the range fermi level can take. This is important because it ensures that the user can understand and complete the next task.<br>
In the ext task the user is provided with a plot of a shrodinger's wave equation and asked to drag the dots provided on the side of the plot and mark the points in which the electron exists(or the points at which we have a solution for the wave equation).
In the next task we have provided the required information of effective mass to the user and have asked the user to match the plots to their respective effective masses.
